Repository Content:
- `src/main/java/mst/` — Java source code:
- `Graph.java `, `Edge.java ` — basic data structures (graph and edge).
-`Prim.java` is an implementation of the Prim algorithm (using PriorityQueue).
- `Kruskal.java`, `DSU.java ` is an implementation of the Kraskal algorithm (with DSU).
- `Main.java ` — entry point: reads `data/assign_3_input.json` and generates `data/assign_3_output_java.json'.
- `data/assign_3_input.json` is an example of input data (multiple graphs).
-`data/assign_3_output_java.json' — results file (generated by the program).
- `pom.xml` is a Maven configuration with a Jackson dependency for working with JSON.
  Input data format
The `data/assign_3_input' file.json` contains an object with the field `graphs`, where each graph has fields:
-`id' — integer (graph ID),
- `nodes' — array of strings (vertex names),
  - - `edges' — array of objects `{ "from": "...", "to": "...", "weight": ... }`.

 Brief remarks on the implementation:
-Prim uses PriorityQueue; operations and time are measured in simple counters and in milliseconds.
-In Kruskal, edges are sorted and DSU with union-by-rank and path-compression is applied.
-The code is focused on clarity — it can be improved for large graphs (for example, optimize the representation, use specialized structures).

Tests and validation:
You can add unit tests (JUnit) to verify the correctness of the MST: the equality of the total cost between the algorithms, the absence of cycles, and the correct size
